description: >
  In New Troll Party, each round everyone secretly bids at the table.
  Win the middle bid to take the scuffle — or deliberately go high or low
  to steal goats and shift the balance.
  After twelve scuffles, the troll who ends up in the middle wins.

how_it_plays:
  - Everyone secretly plays one card each round.
  - The middle card wins the scuffle.
  - The highest or lowest card manipulates goats instead.
  - You must win some scuffles, but not too many.
  - After 12 rounds, whoever ends up in the middle wins.
